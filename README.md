<h1 align="center">SuperGames</h1>

<p align="center"> <a href="https://super-games.pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Games</a>
is an unblocked game site hosting over 100+ unblocked games where the danger of internet restrictions dosent apply. Our purpose to making SuperGames is to ensure everyone can have even the slightest bit of fun in school, whether it's playing the countless amounts of unique games, using school related hacks or just chatting in the chatroom!</p>

<h1 align="center">What makes it so unique?</h1>

<p align="center">SuperGames, unlike most other unblocked game sites, has more than just games, these include a large database of proxy links (auto-selected by which are unblocked), bookmarklets, advanced settings and a fully functional chatroom.</p>

<h1 align="center">Deploy Options</h1>

<p align="center">Due to the sheer size of SuperGames, sometimes the repo may be incapable of deployment, so try the portable version instead (beta testing)</p>
